### Explanation
HTML: Defines the structure of the page and includes necessary scripts.
CSS: Defines styles for nodes and links in the tree visualization.
JavaScript (D3.js):
Loads D3.js library.
Defines treeData representing the tree structure.
createTree function generates the tree layout using D3.js.
traverseTree function performs in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals recursively.

### Notes
This example uses a static tree structure (treeData). If you want user input to dynamically generate the tree, you would need to modify the JavaScript code to handle user input and generate treeData accordingly.
Ensure to include D3.js library via CDN (<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>) in HTML file
